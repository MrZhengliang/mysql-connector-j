THIS IS FORK. OFFICIAL REPOSITORY IS HERE : https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j

---------

This fork provides hardfix. It was made to replace deprecated "storage_engine" variable to "default_storage_engine", so apps can work with MySQL 5.7 instead of throwing exception.

My recent snapshot is /mysql-connector-java-5.1.38-SNAPSHOT-bin.jar
(it was compiled under Debian 8.1 x64 with JDKv1.5 and JDKv1.8)
